# glab
Interactive educational multipurpose package to process and analyse GNSS data.

This branch contains the gLAB source code for version 5.5.1. You can find it [here].

**Caveat**: There was a missing option in `CXXFLAGS` (`-fcommon`) in the `Makefile` of the download link for version 5.5.1. I've corrected it.
